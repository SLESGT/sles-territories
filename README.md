# sles-territories
Allow you to make Gang Zone to warn players when they are in hostile areas in FiveM Roleplay

This script is a lighter version of the qb-territories, I isolated the territories part of his script to create a configurable zone that will trigger a notification and a drawtext to warn you that you are in a "hostile zone"
